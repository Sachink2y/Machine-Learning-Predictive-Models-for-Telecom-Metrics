# Machine-Learning-Predictive-Models-for-Telecom-Metrics
Telecom Predictive Models
Business Problem
In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention and revenue optimization are crucial. This project leverages machine learning models to predict key metrics such as customer activity, average revenue per user (ARPU),  Accurately forecasting these metrics enables proactive identification of potential churn, optimization of marketing strategies, and enhancement of customer experiences for which we are comparing multiple ML models. The business objective here is to provide actionable insights that help retain high-value customers and improve overall profitability.

Approach
Cleaning and sorting data-set Identifying key metrics for predictions and building a pipeline through feature engineering.
then compare with multiple model to check which ML model performance is better

Predicting Month 8 (August): Using the data from June and July, we trained four predictive models:

ARPU Prediction Model: Forecasts Average Revenue Per User.

Comparison with Actual Data: We then compared the predictions for the 8th month (August) with the actual August data to validate the models' accuracy. The results highlight the model's ability to capture trends and make accurate predictions, helping in proactive decision-making and strategic planning.
